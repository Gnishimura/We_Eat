# We_Eat
The Restaurant Recommender for Couples and Friends.  

How much time have you wasted trying to figure out where to eat with your partner or a group of friends?

  "Where should we eat? 
      "I'm cool with anywhere."
        "Me, too.  I'll leave it up to you."

Enough with that.  Use WeEat to save time and eat good.

WeEat learns your tastes, and your partners' tastes, sets up a restaurant profile for the two of you, and offers tailored recommendations, optimized to leave everyone happy!

How do we ensure everyone is satisfied?

Imagine the following scenario:

Users | Restaurant A | Restaurant B 
--- | --- | ---
You | 10 | 7 | 
Your friend | 4 | 7

Pretty obvious when it's laid out like this.  Restaurant B optimizes happiness for both parties.  But in reality we don't know each other's ratings for every restaurant and you will likely recommend your favorite restaurants first, not knowing how your friend feels about them, and vice versa.  It may take 10 ideas before you land on that 7 and 7.  Or, your friend might just be the nonconfrontational Seattle type who will just go with what you say but end up not enjoying the meal. 

And when you add more people, the decisions just get harder and harder.

Users | Restaurant A | Restaurant B | Restaurant C
--- | --- | --- | ---
You | 9 | 5 | 1
Friend | 5 | 7 | 10
Friend2 | 2 | 6 | 10
Friend3 | 4 | 8 | 6

A restaurant choice can make or break a great night.  We should be going about this smarter.
